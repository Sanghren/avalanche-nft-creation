# avalanche-nft-creation
A really ugly script to create NFTs on Avalanche (with a pretty image !)

Only the `nft-create-the-hard-way.ts` script work (more or less, having some issues now and then with it) , I was not able to make the other one `nft-create.ts` work

## ToDo

- [ ] Clean that mess, break the big function in smaller one
- [ ] Understand how to mint NFT in a way they are in the 'same collection' (so with the same AssetID if I understood correctly)

Based on a script made by the awesome cgcardona ;)
